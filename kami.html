        <h3>Favorite Educational Tools</h3>
        <ol>
        <li><h5>Flipgrid</h5>
            <p>Flipgrid is an online tool that allows students to record videos of themselves to be shared with other members in the class. The students can respond to a video with their own video response. It is like a video discussion board. I really like the tool, even for an in person classroom because speaking about a topic or idea requires different skills than writing about it. THe tool also allows for there to be personal element to the discussion.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h5>Peardeck</h5>
            <p>Peardeck is an extension to Google Slides. It allows the slides to be interactive. You can add poll questions, or formative assessment questions. It is a really helpful tool for making a Slides presentation interactive for instruciton and self-guided work.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h5>Kami</h5>
            <p>Kami is a tool that allows you to annotate pdf documents by highlighting, drawing, and leaving voice comments. It allows students' thinkin to be a bit more visible especially with the voice comment. For example, in assigning a worksheet, a student can try to work through the assignment, but if they get stuck, they can leave a voice comment explaining that which they are confused about. The teacher can then comment a response, whether written or spoken, helping the student better understand the topic.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h5>Makey Makey</h5>
            <p>When I taught out of the makerspace at my school (it is currently a classroom), I used Makey Makey's to teach circuitry, design thinking, and inputs and outputs. They are small circuit boards that look kind of a like a game controller. They connect to a device through USB, and serves similar to pressing keys on a keyboard, but instead, you have to physically complete the circuit to send a signal to the computer. My favorite project that I did with students was creating a video game controller using copper tape, carboard, and a Makey Makey.</p>
