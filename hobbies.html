                <h3>Nintendo</h3>
                <p>Nintendo has always been a part of my life. My mother loved video games and enjoyed playing Nintendo games in arcades in Buffalo, NY. When Nintendo came out with the NES she had to purchase one. And, she did, about a month before I was born. Since that time, I have purchased every Nintendo system that was released. I loved playing Mario with my mom, particularly SMB3, and I now play with my son on the Switch. My mother has even joined us from time to time and recently expanded her horizons with Super Smash Brothers.</p>

                <h3>LEGO</h3>
                <p>Lego bricks are amazing. As a child I loved to create in general. I loved stories, and I consumed a lot of them in childhood, and would often recreate those stories using Lego bricks, and mini-figures. I am not sure what prompted that first Lego purchase. I do remember that my dad was often the one buying me Lego sets, bringing them back from Canada, where he worked, when he would come see my sister and I. My first sets were the space sets and the castle sets. After, I moved on to Pirates. One of the most fun things for me, which I think was captured in the Lego movie very well, was the mixing of those sets. Lego allowed for my creations and storytelling to be a mashup of different genres. It was exciting and seemed limitless. I have all of my Lego bricks from my childhood that I have added to over the years, and I now share with my son. </p>

                <h3>Stories</h3>
                <p>I love stories. I love them in any form. My first set of stories came from my parents reading Dr. Seuss to me. I love his creativity, and his ability to tell allegorical stories. From there, I moved on to things like Goosebumps, and a lot of other series of books. Eventually, I discovered the Star Wars Expanded Universe. I really enjoyed reading stories, reading about how authors created stories, and watching stories in the forms of movies and cartoons. When I enjoyed a fictional world, I wanted to know as much about it, the characters, and their experiences as I could. I really enjoy Sci-fi for this reason. I continue to read a lot and watch a lot of movies and shows. I share this love with my wife, and my son, and enjoy watching shows together. Recently, we have started watching WandaVision as a family. It is amazing. I think my love of stories is my core, and it is the common thread in my other hobbies. I hope to one day write and publish a story of my own. I plan on working on that dream once I finished my masters. </p>
