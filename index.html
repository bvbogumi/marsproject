        <p>I love learning. In fact, my love of learning is why I became a teacher. I enjoy working with Elementary school students, and teachers in general. My current role is technology support for the whole school for on campus and off campus faculty and students.</p>
        <p>I also love soccer. <b>A LOT.</b> I played, once upon a time, before multiple knee injuries, but now I coach and watch the English Premier League all of the time. Too much. My wife often complains about my soccer obsession.</p>
        <p>I am married, have a six year old son who loves LEGO, Nintedo, and watching cartoons which are also things I love, so we spend a lot of time building, playing, and watching together.</p>

        <h3>Favorite Educational Tech Tools</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><h3>Flipgrid</h3>
            <p>Flipgrid is an online tool that allows students to record videos of themselves to be shared with other members in the class. The students can respond to a video with their own video response. It is like a video discussion board. I really like the tool, even for an in person classroom because speaking about a topic or idea requires different skills than writing about it. THe tool also allows for there to be personal element to the discussion.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Peardeck</h3>
            <p>Peardeck is an extension to Google Slides. It allows the slides to be interactive. You can add poll questions, or formative assessment questions. It is a really helpful tool for making a Slides presentation interactive for instruciton and self-guided work.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Kami</h3>
            <p>Kami is a tool that allows you to annotate pdf documents by highlighting, drawing, and leaving voice comments. It allows students' thinkin to be a bit more visible especially with the voice comment. For example, in assigning a worksheet, a student can try to work through the assignment, but if they get stuck, they can leave a voice comment explaining that which they are confused about. The teacher can then comment a response, whether written or spoken, helping the student better understand the topic.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Makey Makey</h3>
            <p>When I taught out the makerspace at my school (it is currently a classroom), I used Makey Makey's to teach circuitry, design thinking, and inputs and outputs. They are small circuit boards that look kind of a like a game controller. They connect to a device through USB, and serves similar to pressing keys on a keyboard, but instead, you have to physically complete the circuit to send a signal to the computer. My favorite project that I did with students was creating a video game controller using copper tape, carboard, and a Makey Makey.</p>
