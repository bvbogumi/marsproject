        <h1>Planning!</h1>
        <p><b>STEP ONE</b><br>You will visit <a href="https://earth.google.com/web/@75.14572977,-86.45796331,594.85074296a,904799.365801d,35y,359.90708308h,0t,0r/data=CjESLxIgMTlkNWY5MDBlMTE5MTFlOGJmODQxNWJiNDVkZTkwZTEiC3ZveV9wb2ludF8x" target="_blank"> this link</a> to explore Dover Island which is sometimes called Mars on Earth because it resembles the Martian landscape.<br><b>STEP TWO</b><br>You will be designing four zones for the Martian Colony:
          <ul>
            <li>Food & Water</li>
            <li>Energy</li>
            <li>Fun & Exercise</li>
            <li>Living Quarters</li>
          </ul>
        Each zone can have multiple buildings and will need to be realistic in terms of the technological capabilities of humanity. You need to use existing technology, emerging technology, or hypothetical technology that is currently in a protoype phase. The zones will need to be a closed system because the air on Mars would be toxic to people. Each zone should be connected to one another so people can travel back and forth between zones without having to go outside. So now that you have gathered information on the terrain, start to brainstorm the additional information you will need to research to create a realistic colony on Mars. What do you need to know about food production in an environment that is not quite ready to grow food? You can't just plant a seed in the ground of Mars and expect it to grow or be edible if it does. Are there any problems you know you will need to focus on solving from the beginning like Mars's toxic soil or a lack of an atmosphere that filters out the the Sun's death rays? Use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iq1GjwDP_hW6rRtJ0GFffxpsMWBuLEf_Qj-9BFWrFTI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> Google Doc</a> to help you organize your questiosn by zone.<br><b>STEP THREE</b><br>Now, you have a lot of questions, and those questions need answers. You will be assigned a zone to focus on, and you find others in Mr. Tusk's Mars Planning Research Group (your classroom) who have the same zone. You will work together to research the answers to the questions you came up with.<br><b>STEP FOUR</b><br>Now that you are done with all of that research, you will be assigned to a group of 4. Each member of the group will be a different zone expert. You will share your research with one another and start brainstorming ideas for the colony. You can organize your efforts however you would like, for example, if each expert wants to focus on designing their zone, that is fine, or you could mix it up and work together to design each zone, but remember, it needs to be a cohesive design. As you start finalizing your design, you will want to think about how to present it to the rest of the groups. <br><b>STEP FIVE</b><br>Share your designs with the other groups. After each presentation, the other groups will share one thing they noticed that was similar to their design, and something that was different and a good idea that the final design should incporate, and something that was different, but could improve. You will submit your group's response to each presentation using <a href=form.html> this form.</a></p>
