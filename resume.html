          <h3>A Brief Biography</h3>
          <p>I love learning. In fact, my love of learning is why I became a teacher. I enjoy working with Elementary school students, and teachers in general. My current role is technology support for the whole school for on campus and off campus faculty and students. Next year, I will be in a new role called Technology Integration Coordinator. I look fowrrad to that role and my new responsibilities.</p>
          <p>I also love soccer. <b>A LOT.</b> I played, once upon a time, before multiple knee injuries, but now I coach and watch the English Premier League all of the time. Some might say too much. My wife often complains about my soccer obsession.</p>
          <p>I am married, have a six year old son who loves LEGO, Nintedo, and watching cartoons which are also things I love, so we spend a lot of time building, playing, and watching together.</p>
