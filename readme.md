## About Me
My name is **Brandon Bogumil** and I *love* learning about, and putting into action the intersection of the practice of teaching and technology. I particularly enjoy working with Elementary students and teachers. I work at a private school in Raleigh called [St. Timothy's School](https://sttimothys.org). I currently, courtesty of the pandemic, am in a technology support position where I have helped our teachers, students, and parents with our distance learning efforts. We have been on campus since the start of the year, and we also offer distance learning for families who have chosen to be off campus, and for those who are in quarantine. It has been a fun, at times frustrating, and often challening task. 
## Hobbies 
While I **absolutely love teaching**, and like *most* teachers, could talk about it all the time, I do other things too. 
1. I play soccer, slowly these days, as I have had each ligament in both knees replaced at this point after having injured them playing soccer
1. I watch **A LOT OF** (maybe too much) soccer. The English Premier League is my personal favorite. My favorite team is [Aston Villa](https://youtu.be/GDUXhVLEBSI). The link is a 17 minute video of their best goals.
1. I play with Lego bricks with my six year old son, devoting a whole room in the house to our creations, as well as video games like:
    1. Minecraft
    1. Pokemon
    1. Every iteration of Mario ever
1. I read a lot, my favorite current series is **The Expanse**, and I also like comics and manga like Robert Kirkman's **Invincible**, and current series **Firepower**, and **Fullmetal Alchemist**.
